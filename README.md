# odin-landing-page

I, Linum-usitatissimum from a rural and remote part of Australia, have created this project, the Landing Page, for The Odin Project's assignment project as part of it's foundational course, as can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page 

This project requires me to create a landing page for a fake (nonexistant) business, making it look as close as possible to that which has been shown on in the coursework's assignment, using the skills and knowledge I have gained so far in the course and a little bit more that I haven't yet gained but will gain through researching as I create this project.

This Project does not require me to make the webpage look good on anything but Desktop.

## Disclaimer

I have done this particular project before. I am redoing Odin's Foundational course so that I can thoroughly embed the information into my brain and make sure I understand what I'm doing. 

## Requirements

There are no requirements for viewing these files apart from having a device that can access this material. Nothing fancy, just html and css.


## Self-feedback for my learning during/post creation of this project:


### What caused me problems during the creation of this project:

I had issues with the responsiveness of the page, and although I'm understanding flex-box better than I was, I still have trouble with it.

### What new things did I discover during the creation of this project:

Adding bright and loud borders to boxes helps visualise what is going wrong. I already knew this, but somehow always seem to forget that this is helpful when I'm css-ing and not understanding why the thing isn't doing what I am trying to tell it to do.

Also, I discovered that I need to make a better plan before I tackle a project - write down everything in a logical order and work through it one at a time. 

I also discovered that my css is a huge mess and needs cleaning up. And I need to keep better css notes.

### What is one thing I can take away from this project to learn from:

Plan better, and write your css and css notes as though you won't remember what you are doing, because you won't. You'll go make a coffee, get a phone call, have someone knock on the door and chat at you, and you'll forget why you did what you did and what your intentions were at that moment.

Also, keep reading about/learning about/playing with the boxes and their contents, because that is a challenge that seems to be getting easier over time, but you still struggle.

## NOTE FOR NOW REGARDING STAGE PAGE IS AT:

Page is finished (given my current level of knowledge and skill I don't think I can do much better), but the css is an awful mess. I will be trying to clean it up over the coming weeks, alongside continuing with my studies.
