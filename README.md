# odin-landing-page

I, Linum-usitatissimum from a rural and remote part of Australia, have created this project, the Landing Page, for The Odin Project's assignment project as part of it's foundational course, as can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page 

This project requires me to create a landing page for a fake (nonexistant) business, making it look as close as possible to that which has been shown on in the coursework's assignment, using the skills and knowledge I have gained so far in the course and a little bit more that I haven't yet gained but will gain through researching as I create this project.

This Project does not require me to make the webpage look good on anything but Desktop.

## Disclaimer

I have done this particular project before. I am redoing Odin's Foundational course so that I can thoroughly embed the information into my brain and make sure I understand what I'm doing. 

## Requirements

There are no requirements for viewing these files apart from having a device that can access this material. Nothing fancy, just html and css.
